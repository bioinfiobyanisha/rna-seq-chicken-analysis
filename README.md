# Genome Annotation and RNA-seq Analysis Project  
---

### Week-by-Week Bioinformatics Workflow (8 Weeks)

## Project Overview
This repository documents a week-by-week bioinformatics workflow focused on
RNA-seq data processing and large-scale genome annotation across multiple species.
The project involves quality control of sequencing data, genome preparation,
chromosome-level scaffolding, and reference-based gene annotation using established
bioinformatics tools.

This work was carried out as part of a research internship/training at  
**National Institute of Animal Biotechnology (NIAB), Hyderabad**,  
under the guidance of **Dr. Shailesh Sharma (Scientist F)**.

- Completed reference-based annotation transfer for sheep genomes  
- Generated GTF/GFF3 files for 10 goat breeds using goat reference FASTA and GTF files  
- Prepared annotated datasets for downstream comparative analysis  

---

### Week 7 – Gene-Level Comparative Analysis (1 February)

- Generated GTF files for 22 goat species  
- Developed a custom Python script for gene-level analysis  
- Performed:
  - Total gene count calculation per species  
  - Identification of common genes across species  
  - Identification of breed/species-specific genes  
  - Extraction and recording of gene names  
- Compiled all outputs into structured Excel files  
- Generated an UpSet plot to visualize total, common, and breed-specific gene distributions  

---

### Week 8 – Multi-Species Analysis & Visualization Refinement (7 February)

- Generated GTF files for different goat breeds  
- Performed gene count analysis for pig, identifying common and species-specific genes  
- Organized all results into Excel datasets  
- Generated an UpSet plot for gene overlap visualization  
- Identified limitations in the current visualization and initiated refinement  
- Extended the workflow to sheep and goat comparative analysis  
- Initiated GTF file generation for cow and buffalo datasets
---

## Key Outcomes
- Established a complete RNA-seq preprocessing and genome annotation workflow
- Generated GTF/GFF3 files for multiple chicken and sheep breeds
- Successfully applied chromosome-level scaffolding and annotation transfer
- Maintained detailed week-by-week documentation for reproducibility

## Current Status

✔ Genome annotation and GTF/GFF3 generation completed for multiple livestock species (chicken, sheep, goat, pig)  
✔ Chromosome-level genome assemblies successfully utilized where available  
✔ Gene-level analysis performed to identify total, common, and species-specific genes  
✔ Results systematically compiled into Excel datasets for interpretation  
✔ UpSet plots generated to visualize gene overlaps across species  
✔ A reusable multi-species genome annotation and analysis workflow established

---

## Future Work

• Extend genome annotation and comparative analysis to additional livestock species (cow, buffalo)  
• Refine and optimize UpSet and other visualization methods for clearer interpretation  
• Integrate downstream RNA-seq analysis with comparative genomics results  
• Perform functional annotation and biological interpretation of common and species-specific genes  
• Prepare the workflow and results for publication-quality analysis
