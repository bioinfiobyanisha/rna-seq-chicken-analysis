## Week 7 – 1 February

## Progress Report on Gene-Level Comparative Analysis

---

## Overview

This week focused on gene-level comparative analysis across multiple goat species using generated annotation files and custom scripting approaches.

---

## Goat Genome Annotation

### Annotation Generation
- Successfully generated GTF files for 22 goat species

---

## Gene-Level Analysis

Using the generated GTF files, Anji Bhaiya and I developed a Python-based analysis script to perform detailed gene-level comparisons.

### Analysis Performed
The script was used to:
- Calculate the total gene count for each species
- Identify common genes across species
- Identify breed-specific genes
- Extract and record the names of the identified genes

---

## Results Compilation and Visualization

- All analysis results were systematically compiled into Excel sheets for clear interpretation and record keeping
- Generated an UpSet plot to visually represent:
  - Total gene counts
  - Common genes
  - Breed-specific gene counts across species

---

## Summary

- Completed GTF generation for 22 goat species
- Developed and applied a custom Python workflow for gene-level analysis
- Generated tabular and visual outputs supporting comparative genomics insights
