# Week 4 – 11 January  
## Progress Update on Chicken Genome Annotation (Liftoff)

## Overview
This week focused on large-scale gene annotation transfer using Liftoff
for chromosome-level assembled chicken genomes.

---

## Genome Assembly Status
- Total chicken genomes analyzed: 45
- Chromosome-level assembled breeds: 19
- Liftoff annotation completed for **all 19 chromosome-assembled breeds**

---

## GTF Annotation Generation Using Liftoff

### Annotation Availability
- Several chromosome-assembled chicken breeds did not have available GTF files

### Reference Genome Strategy
- Downloaded the **pig reference genome**
- Used pig as a reference for Liftoff annotation transfer where chicken
  reference annotations were unavailable

### Results
- Successfully generated **GTF annotation files for 6 chicken breeds**
  using Liftoff
- Annotation transfer completed without errors for these breeds

---

## Current Status
✔ Liftoff annotation completed for all chromosome-level assembled breeds  
✔ GTF files generated for 6 previously unannotated chicken breeds  
✔ Annotation strategy validated using alternative reference genome  

---

## Plan for Next Week
- Continue running Liftoff to generate GTF files for remaining
  chromosome-assembled breeds lacking annotations
- Review annotation completeness and consistency
- Proceed toward annotation coverage expansion across all suitable genomes
